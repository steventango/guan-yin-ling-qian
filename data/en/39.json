Meng Jiangnu traveled thousands of miles to send her husband warm clothes. It took a long time to get to the Great Wall, but in the end she was told that her husband was dead and his body was buried under the Great Wall. Meng Jiangnu burst into tears, and the Great Wall collapsed, and her husband's remains were found with blood dripping on the pile of bones. Qin Shihuang therefore summoned Meng Jiangnu, who was so shocked that he wanted to take Meng Jiangnu as his concubine. Meng Jiangnu asked Qin Shihuang to go to Qinhuang Island to pay homage to Fan Qiliang, and Qin Shihuang agreed; after Qin Shihuang paid homage to Fan Qiliang, Meng Jiangnu held her husband's body at the site of the Meng Jiangnu Temple today.
