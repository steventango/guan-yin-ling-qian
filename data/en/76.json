He was born in a poor peasant family. Due to poverty when he was young, he was unable to study and once herded cattle for the landlord.\nIn the fourth year of Zhizheng (1344), there was a severe drought in Huaibei. Zhu Yuanzhang's father, mother, and brother died successively, so he had no choice but to become a novice monk in Huangjue Temple.\nLess than two months after entering the temple, due to the difficulty in collecting the rent of the temple in the famine years, the temple owner closed the warehouse and dismissed the monks. Zhu Yuanzhang had to leave his hometown and become a wandering monk (a monk who made a living by begging).\nLater, Zhu Yuanzhang became the Taizu of the Ming Dynasty and the \"civilian emperor\" in Chinese history, with the reign name \"Hongwu\".\n(The metaphor of this story is that being ordinary for a while does not mean that it will be the same in the future. This is because the time has not yet come.)", "聖意": "The house is safe.\nSelf: Kangtai.\nSeeking wealth Yes.\nTransaction Waiting for time.\nMarriage is late.\nLiujia: Give birth to a boy.\nPedestrian: Late.\nField silkworms have a late harvest.\n\n\nSix animals have sharp tail.\nLooking for people, not found.\nLitigation postponed.\nMigration.
